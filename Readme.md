# Window Resize Component

## Solved the Broken code.

Here is a small challenger about React using React Class Components.

Feel free to contribute.

```
  Below you will find exemplary component that does nothing until window resize.
  On window resize it:
  - asynchronously fetches window dimensions,
  - informs parent about calculated total of even indexed dimensions,
  - shows multiplied entries on the screen.

  Fix errors and improve code quality (remove or add code if needed).
  Use TypeScript.
  entries are null initially until data is fetched.

  React version 17
``` 

That was such a crazy puzze :D.
